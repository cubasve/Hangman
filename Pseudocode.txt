Pseudocode for Hangman

1. CONSTANTS
    - Array of random words with the same category --> foodArray = ['apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'banana'];
    - Ex. Topics: Celebrities, cities, food, sports, etc.


2. VARIABLES (APP'S STATE)
    - Choose a random word from the array --> randomWord = array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
    - guessedLetters: adds letters the player already guessed into the array 
    - answer: __ __ __ __ --> the random word in dashes/underscores
    - mistakes: tracks the player's wrong guesses


3. CACHED ELEMENT REFERENCES
    - inputBoxEl: get the value of the player's input --> box.value
    - messageEl: tells the player if they entered something wrong in the box
    - guessedLetters: updates during the course of the game


4. EVENT LISTENERS
    - Add letter button
    - Reset/initialize button


5. FUNCTIONS

    A. Initialize()
    - Resets the game
    - Assign game's variables: 
        - randomWord = array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
        - guessedLetters = [] --> empty array where letters will be added
        - answer = [] --> empty array that will have randomWord's letter converted to underscores
        - mistakes = 0 --> game just started, player has no mistakes
    - Call render()


    B. Render()
    - answer = [];
    - Use for loop to iterate through each letter of randomWord, and replace it with an underline/dash instead
        - answer.replace([i], '__')
    - Use .join(' ') to separate the underscores


    C. verifyGuess()
    - If the guess !== 1, === null, or is a number (isNaN()), tell the player to enter one letter using messageEl
    - If the guess.length is 1, add the guess onto the guessedLetters array
        - If correctGuess : renderAnswerHTML() --> ask them to guess again
        - If incorrectGuess: add a body part to the hangman --> add a mistake (maximum of 6) --> ask them to guess again


    D. renderAnswerHTML()
    - answerHTML = []; --> an empty array
    - Use for loop to iterate through each letter of the randomWord
    - If the guessedLetters array has a letter of the randomWord, add it onto answerHTML
    - If the guessedLetters array DOES NOT have a letter of the randomWord, add an underscore
    - Use .join(' ') to separate the underscores
