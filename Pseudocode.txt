    - Ex. Celebrities, cities, food, sports, etc.
foodArray = ['apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'banana'];


2. VARIABLES (APP'S STATE)
    - Choose a random word from the array --> randomWord = foodArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
    - guessedLetters: adds letters the player already guessed --> an array
    - answer: __ __ __ __ --> the random word in dashes/underscores
    - mistakes: tracks the player's wrong guesses


3. CACHED ELEMENT REFERENCES

    - guessedLetters



4. EVENT LISTENERS
    - Add letter button
    - Reset/initialize button


5. FUNCTIONS
    A. Initialize()
    - Resets the game
    - Assign game's variables: randomWord, guessedLetters, answer, mistakes
    - Call render()

    B. Render()
    - answer is an empty array --> answer = [];
    - Loop through each letter of randomWord, and replace it with an underline/dash instead
    - Use .join(' ') to separate the underscores

    C. verifyGuess()
    - If the guess !== 1, === null, or is a number (isNaN()), tell the player using messageEl
    - If the guess.length is 1, add the guess onto the guessedLetters array
    - Want the user to see what letters they have chosen already: 



    D. renderAnswerHTML()
    - answerHTML = []; --> an empty array
    - Loop through each letter of the randomWord
    - If the guessedLetters array has a letter of the randomWord, add it onto answerHTML
    - If the guessedLetters array DOES NOT have a letter of the randomWord, add an underscores
    - Use .join(' ') to separate the underscores

   






1. Array of random words 
    - Words are strings 
    - All words have the same category (ex. food, celebrity, cities, etc.)
    - foodArray = ['apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'banana'];

2. Choose a random word from the array
    - randomWord = foodArray[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
    
3. Turn the letters of the randomWord into dashes/underscores
    -
