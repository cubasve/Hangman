# Hangman

Description: The user is presented with a word or phrase in underscores and they guess letters one at a time to eventually correctly guess the word/phrase. Each character that is not in the word/phrase will result in a body part being drawn. The user can only make 6 mistakes before the hangman is completely drawn. May the odds be in your favor.
