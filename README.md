# Hangman

Description: 
The player is presented with a word or phrase in underscores, where each line represents a letter. The player then has to guess one letter at a time to eventually get the phrase. Each character that is incorrectly guessed and is not in the word/phrase will result in a body part being drawn. The user can only make 6 mistakes before the hangman is completely drawn. 

May the odds be in your favor.
Have fun!

Getting Started: Game link


Next Steps: Planned future enhancements
- Multi-player game: Instead of just a single player, this game could include multiple, which makes things more fun.
- More categories: The current categories of the game are limited to food. Having more variety appeals to more potential users.
- Incorporate phrases: Only words were used in this current version of the game. Using phrases makes the game more difficult and fun.
- User can guess the entire word/phrase if they choose to: Instead of guessing one character at a time until all characters are filled up, if the player knows the phrase beforehand, they can type in their guess for the entire word/phrase. 
- Include a built-in keyboard into the application: Rather than the user using their keyboard on their laptop or phone, the game could incorporate a built-in keyword, which makes for a better user experience.
