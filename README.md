# Hangman

**Description:**
The player is presented with a random word in underscores, where each line represents a letter in the word.
The player inputs a guess one letter at a time to eventually guess the full word. 
Each character that is incorrectly guessed and is not in the word/phrase will result in a body part being drawn. 
The user can only make six mistakes before the hangman is completely drawn. 
May the odds be in your favor.
Have fun!

**Next Steps: Planned future enhancements**
- Multi-player game: Instead of just a single player, this game could include multiple, which makes things more fun.

- Include categories: The current category of the game is limited to food. Having more variety appeals to more potential users.

- Incorporate phrases: Only words were used in this current version of the game. Using phrases makes the game more difficult and fun.

- The player can guess the entire word/phrase if they choose to: Instead of guessing one character at a time until all characters are filled up, the player can type in their guess for the entire word/phrase at any time. 

- Include a built-in keyboard for the application: Rather than the user using their keyboard on their laptop or phone, the game could incorporate a built-in keyword, which makes for a better user experience.
